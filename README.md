# sn-outlook-greasemonkey

The default theme options on Outlook all seem to be white background on white text 
so I can't see anything in the calendar or in the email preview panel to name but a few. 
This script fixes it!

## instructions

1. Install the Greasemonkey browser plugin for chrome/firefox
2. Either
  - open the .user.js script in a browser which Greasemonkey will detect and offer to install for you
  - open the greasemonkey plugin > Select "New user script..." > paste the contents of the .user.js file and save
